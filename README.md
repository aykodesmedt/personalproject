# Personal Project - Sign Language 

## Concept 
An online ThreeJS game, where people can learn the Dutch Sign Language Alphabet. I want to create a world where they can choose between two things. Learning the alphabet or playing the word game. While you're standing in from of a hand statue in the world, you'll be able to press a button 'try it for yourself'. Then the website is going to analyse your gesture with TensorflowJS. You'll be given a word from the database. You'll have to walk around in this world and spell this word in sign language with the help of these hand statues.
